            <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
            <p>
                First, welcome to the about us page, we are very happy that you have choosen to click on this page and learn more about us!
                <br>
                <br>
                During the heart of lockdown, like most of the world, Safiya Nazerali spent a lot
                <br>of her time at home. She felt that something was missing, so she tried candle making
                <br>with her family as an afternoon activity. The candle lit up the room, made the house smell divine
                <br>and gave off a warming atmosphere. She felt that every home should be able to experience
                <br>what her and her family felt and that is how The Candle Shop was born.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Safiya had found a new passion in candles, specifically made exclusively with soy wax, due to the harms
                <br>that come accompanied with paraffin wax. Which is why it has been her mission to provide a chemically safe
                <br>candle to be enjoyed for all, from pets to children and adults, in addition becoming a eco friendly company.
